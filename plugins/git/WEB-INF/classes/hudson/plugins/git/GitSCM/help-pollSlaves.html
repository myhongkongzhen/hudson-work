  <p>If checked, poll using the state of the repository in the workspace on the last build slave (default).
  Otherwise, poll using the state of the last built repository kept on master. This is
  the preferred option if slaves are dynamically added and removed, e.g., from a slave pool.</p>
  <p>Note that if the per-job "remote polling" option is enabled, polling is based on
  a single status value kept on master. This speeds up polling in simple cases. However,
  it does not work if a job uses more than one branch or repository, or excluded regions
  or users. Moreover, a slave may still be contacted to obtain environment variables.
  Only disabling Poll slaves ensures that slaves are not used by polling for any reason.</p>
